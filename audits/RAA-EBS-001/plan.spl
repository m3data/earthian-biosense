VERIFY: Read /Users/m3untold/Code/EarthianLabs/Earthian-BioSense/src/processing/hrv.py and any test files in /Users/m3untold/Code/EarthianLabs/Earthian-BioSense/tests/. Check: 1) Is the claimed behavior implemented? Are RMSSD, SDNN, pNN50 computed per clinical definitions (Task Force 1996 standards)? 2) Does the implementation match the claim's specificity — are these truly 'clinically meaningful' or just mathematically correct? 3) What edge cases or failure modes exist (short windows, missing RR intervals, ectopic beats, artifacts)? 4) Are there gaps between what is claimed and what the code does? 5) Is the claim testable from static analysis alone? Write finding to findings-a/01-hrv-metrics-clinical-accuracy.md.")
