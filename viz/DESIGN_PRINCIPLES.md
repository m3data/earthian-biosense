# Design Principles for Session Replay

*These principles guide the visualization of biosignal sessions in EarthianBioSense. They are not technical specifications but ethical and phenomenological commitments that shape every design decision.*

---

## Core Intention

**Induce somatic recognition, prevent identity fixation.**

The replay visualization must evoke a felt sense of recognition — *"yes, that was me moving"* — without collapsing into identity claims — *"this is what I am."*

We are not showing people who they are. We are offering a mirror for how something moved through them.

---

## The Mutual Constraint Frame

The visualization exists in the space between first-person narrative and third-person measurement. It is not:

- "My story explains the data"
- "The data tells my story"

It is a *co-creation* where both elements inform and shape each other. The interstices between story and data are where new understanding emerges.

The participant's felt sense and the biosignal trace are two perspectives on the same becoming. Neither has epistemic priority. They mutually constrain.

---

## What We Are Not Building

### Not a wellness dashboard

We avoid the trap of "look how relaxed I am" or "look how stressed I am." There is no good state to achieve. There is only the process of becoming, the unfolding of experience over time.

### Not a diagnostic tool

We do not uncover pre-existing truths about the participant. We do not classify, diagnose, or evaluate. The visualization invites exploration, not assessment.

### Not a map of the territory

The participant is not the map or measure. They are the territory — a lossy compressed reflection of the field that emerges between self and world. The visualization is a map of a map, twice removed from the living process it references.

### Not a static representation

The nervous system does not move in 2D or 3D. It moves in high-dimensional space that constantly shifts and evolves. Spatial metaphors are limited. We think in patterns, rhythms, and flows that transcend traditional spatial representation.

---

## Phenomenological Primacy

The felt sense comes first.

### Reflection before revelation

Prompt the participant to describe what they felt *before* showing any visualization. The narrative shapes what becomes visible in the data, and vice versa.

### Invite narrative agency

Use prompts that honour the participant's authority over their own experience:

- "What was moving in you at this time?"
- "What does this shape evoke?"
- "Is there something here you want to explore more deeply?"

### Maintain ambiguity

Avoid definitive interpretations. The visualization should feel slightly ungraspable — familiar but not fixed. This prevents reification of living process into static trait.

---

## Non-Objectifying Visualization

### No evaluative encoding

Colours, positions, and sizes must not carry implicit judgment. No green=good, red=bad. No up=better, down=worse. The palette should feel warm and grounding, not clinical or performative.

### Organic, living forms

Use soft edges, subtle oscillations, breathing-like animations. The trace is alive and relational. Sharp lines and static markers reify what should remain fluid.

### Flows over points

Emphasize temporal morphology — how the trace *moves* — over isolated moments. The journey matters more than any single state.

### Impermanence

Include gentle opacity shifts, subtle drift, elements that convey that this representation is provisional, not permanent truth.

---

## Earth-Warm Palette

The color palette should evoke grounding, not performance.

### Warm tones

Ochres, ambers, deep terracottas, soft clay. These colors connect to earth, body, root. They invite settling rather than striving.

### Avoid clinical colours

No pure whites, no hospital greens, no alert reds. The aesthetic should feel like firelight, not fluorescent.

### Motion from below

Visual movement should rise from the root upward, echoing the somatic sense of warmth rising through the body. This is not arbitrary — it shapes the felt response to the visualisation.

---

## Participant Agency

### Annotation as co-creation

Participants can mark regions of the trace with their own language: "tightening," "softening," "opening," "dispersing." These annotations become part of the reflective dataset — not corrections to the visualisation but additions to it.

### Permission to disagree

Provide explicit options: "This point was not significant for me." "This does not match my experience." The visualisation is an offer, not an assertion.

### The participant's words matter

When annotations are made, they carry equal epistemic weight to the computed metrics. The system does not privilege its own interpretation.

---

## Pacing and Revelation

### Gentle pacing

Playback should allow lingering. The default speed is slow enough to feel, not just observe.

### Delayed complexity

Show the trace first, alone. Analytic layers (velocity vectors, stability metrics, mode labels) appear only on request, only when the participant is ready for that frame.

### Second-reaction design

The intended arc: initial somatic recognition (warmth, familiarity), followed by soft curiosity (what is this? can I explore?). Design for both reactions, in that order.

---

## The Triadic Frame

This work operates in three co-constitutive dimensions:

1. **Phenomenology** — the felt, lived experience of the participant
2. **Physiology** — the biosignal trace, the measurement
3. **Field dynamics** — the relational context, the between

Each constrains and informs the others. The visualization must honor all three without collapsing them into each other.

---

## Holding Lightly

Bruce Lee, from the Tao of Jeet Kune Do:

> "How can there be methods and systems to arrive at something that is living? To that which is static, fixed, dead, there can be a way, a definite path, but not to that which is living. Do not reduce reality to a static thing and then invent methods to reach it."

We hold these principles lightly. They are guides, not laws. The living process we are trying to serve will exceed any framework we build. The best we can do is stay responsive, keep listening, and revise when the work tells us we've drifted.

## Practical Implications

These principles translate into specific design choices:

| Principle | Implication |
|-----------|-------------|
| Somatic recognition | Smooth, organic trail; breathing animation |
| No identity fixation | Avoid persistent labels; emphasize flow |
| Mutual constraint | Annotation layer; disagreement options |
| No evaluation | Neutral palette; no good/bad encoding |
| Earth-warm aesthetic | Ochres, ambers, terracottas |
| Phenomenological primacy | Reflection prompts before visualization |
| Delayed revelation | Metrics hidden by default |
| Living, not static | Subtle motion; impermanence cues |

*These principles are themselves provisional. They will evolve as we learn from actual sessions, actual participants, actual moments of recognition and misrecognition. The document is alive.*
